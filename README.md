Bellman Ford Algorithm: 

Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given
graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges.

Input: Graph and a source vertex src

Output: Shortest distance to all vertices from src. If there is a negative weight cycle, then shortest 
distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.
